Answer 5
Nearest Neighbour results in a sharp image, when it is used to zoom an image, it results in high amount of 
pixalation causing to degrade the picture quality, where as the bicubic and bilinear results in less pixalation
due to good approximations(better for bicubic). When  Nearest Neighbour is used to rotate an image it results 
in better quality(sharp and clear), where as bicubic and bilinear results in a blurry image.
